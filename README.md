## Hire Brad Geesaman

I'm **Brad Geesaman** ðŸ‘‹ , a Senior Cloud-Native and Kubernetes Security Professional with years of experience building and securing Google Cloud, AWS, and Kubernetes Security platforms at several organizations of varying scale.  I've been an active member of the Kubernetes community since 2017 and have focused on educating and guiding platform and security teams to run containerized workloads securely with minimal friction.  I am a strong advocate for migration to cloud-native and containerized workloads in accordance with the desired threat model and in balance with the needs of the business.

My specialties are **building on, attacking, and hardening Kubernetes, Google Cloud, and AWS** environments.  I enjoy evaluating features and capabilities for their security posture, demonstrating weaknesses through hands-on walkthroughs, and developing educational materials for end users to be able to protect their own environments.  I know that security teams often lack deep Kubernetes expertise, and cloud infrastructure teams often lack deep security expertise.  I want to be in a position to bridge that gap and bring clarity to their day-to-day lives for a given issue.

**And I'm actively looking for my next opportunity!**

* **Location:** Remote or Northern Virginia. (Remote preferred)
* **Employment Type:** Full time employee
* **Example Roles:** Security Advocacy, Product Security Research

**My CV is available [online](https://bgeesaman.github.io) or [PDF](https://github.com/bgeesaman/bgeesaman.github.io/raw/main/BradGeesaman_CV.pdf)**
