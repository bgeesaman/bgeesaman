## Hello

I'm **Brad Geesaman** ðŸ‘‹ , a Cloud Native Cyber Security Professional at [Ghost](ghost.security)

In the past, I've been:
- [building on](https://darkbit.io/blog/google-cloud-custom-iam-role-debugging-tricks)
- [attacking](https://youtu.be/vTgQLzeBfRU) and 
- [hardening](https://darkbit.io/blog/gke-shielded-nodes)
    - [Kubernetes](https://github.com/darkbitio/k8s-mirror)
    - [Google Cloud](https://darkbit.io/blog/cve-2020-15157-containerdrip), and
    - [AWS](https://github.com/OpenCSPM/opencspm) environments.

I'v also enjoyed:
- [evaluating features and capabilities for their security posture](https://darkbit.io/blog/falco-rule-bypass),
- [demonstrating weaknesses through hands-on walkthroughs](https://youtu.be/JDUUdaZv1Dg?t=93), and
- [developing educational materials for end users](https://youtu.be/UdMFTdeAL1s) to be able to protect their own environments.

Lately, I've had fun [getting deep into using LLMs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqT_7aZ1wSw) to solve the problem of toil in AppSec.
